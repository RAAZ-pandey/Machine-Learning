# Breast Cancer Classification ðŸ§¬

This project focuses on classifying breast tumors as **malignant** or **benign** using machine learning techniques. It's built using Python and Scikit-learn and leverages the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- **Objective:** Accurately classify tumors to support early detection of breast cancer.
- **Algorithm Used:** Random Forest Classifier


## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (for visualizations)
- Scikit-learn

## ðŸš€ Features

- Data preprocessing: handling nulls, scaling, encoding
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC
- Visualizations:
  - Confusion Matrix Heatmap
  - ROC Curve
  - Feature Importance Plot

## ðŸ“Š Results

The Random Forest model showed high accuracy in classifying tumors, with strong performance across all evaluation metrics.

## ðŸ“Ž How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
