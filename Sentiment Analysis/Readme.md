# Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning ðŸ§ âœ¨

This project demonstrates a basic **Sentiment Analysis** pipeline using Python and machine learning libraries like **Scikit-learn** and **NLTK**. It classifies text data (e.g., tweets, reviews) into **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** sentiments.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Text data preprocessing (removing stop words, punctuation, and more)
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
- Classification using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
- Model evaluation with:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for visualization)

.

## ðŸ“Š Example Output
Once trained, the models are evaluated using standard metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. You can tweak the dataset or try different models to improve performance.

## ðŸ’¡ Learnings
   - Basics of NLP preprocessing
   - Understanding and applying TF-IDF
   - Training simple yet effective ML classifiers
   - Interpreting model performance on textual data
